SUMMARY

Contains examples of PyMS use discussed in the PyMS User Guide

CONTENT

Basics
------

01/ -- Example demonstrating reading of GC-MS data from ANDI-MS files, how to
    obtain ion chromatogram and TIC, and how to save data to a file

02/ -- Explanation of signal peaks

03/ -- Example showing how to create an experiment from the ChemStation
    ANDI-MS file and the peak integration report files

Peak alignment examples
-----------------------

04/ -- Preparation of experiments for peak alignment by dynamic programming

04a/ -- Preparation of another set of experiments for peak alignment. This
    used in example 06/ where two the sets of experiments (prepared in 04/
    and 04a/) are aligned together

05/ -- Example of within-state peak alignment by dynamic programming. The
    experiments prepared in the example 04 are aligned

06/ -- Example of within-state and between-state peak alignment by dynamic
    programming. The experiments prepared in examples 04/ and 04a/ are
    aligned

Data pre processing
-------------------

11/ -- Noise filtering with mean/median moving windows 

12/ -- Top hat Baseline correction
