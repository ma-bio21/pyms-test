SUMMARY

Contains examples of PyMS use given in the User Guide.

CONTENT

Chapter 2 -- GC-MS data file reading and operations
---------

20a/ -- Reading of GC-MS raw data in the JCAMP-DX format,
    and some properties of raw data object. The JCAMP-DX
    file used in this example was generated by GC/MS File
    Translator Pro (Scientific Instrument Services, Inc)

20b/ -- Reading of GC-MS raw data in the ANDI-MS format,
    and some properties of raw data object. The ANDI-MS file
    used in this example was generated by Agilent ChemStation.

20c/ -- Use of data information, info(), function

20d/ -- Illustrates the use of diff() function

Chapter 3 -- GC-MS data structure
---------

30a/ -- Demonstrates building of the intensity matrix from
    raw GC-MS data, and some basic methods of the IntensityMatrix

30b/ -- Build intensity matrix parameters.

30c/ -- Build integer mass intensity matrix using bin boundary of
    -0.3 and +0.7.

31/ -- MassSpectrum and IonChromatogram objects of an IntensityMatrix

31/ -- Saving IonChromatogram and IntensityMatrix information.

Chapter 4 -- Data filtering
---------

40a/ -- Trim raw data retention time/scan range

40b/ -- Crop mass range and ignore given masses

41a/ -- Noise filtering with the mean/median moving window filter, on TIC

41b/ -- Noise filtering with the Savitzky-Golay filter, on TIC

42/ -- TopHat baseline correction, on TIC

43/ -- A pre-processing of data by ICs (building of the intensity matrix,
    smoothing each IC with the Savitzky-Golay filter and baseline correction
    with the TopHat corrector)

Chapter 5 -- Peaks and Peak detection
---------

50/ -- Demonstrates a Peak object and its properties.
