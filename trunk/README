SUMMARY

Contains examples of PyMS use discussed in the PyMS User Guide

CONTENT

Data I/O and miscallaneous
--------------------------

01/ -- Example demonstrating reading of GC-MS data from ChemStation (Agilent
    Technologies) ANDI-MS files, shows how to obtain ion chromatogram and TIC,
    and how to save data to a file

01a/ -- Xcalibur (Thermo) ANDI-MS file example, similar to 01/

02/ -- Explanation of signal peaks

03/ -- Example showing how to create an experiment from the ChemStation
    ANDI-MS file and the peak integration report files

03a/ -- Example showing how to create an experiment from the Xcalibur
    ANDI-MS file and the peak report file

03b/ -- Creating an experiment from Xcalibur ANDI-MS data with AMDIS
    generated peak list

09/ -- Calculation of mass isotope distribution in 13C experiments

Data pre processing
-------------------

11/ -- Noise filtering with the mean/median moving window filter

12/ -- Noise filtering with the Savitzky-Golay filter

Beseline correction
-------------------

21/ -- Top-hat baseline correction

Peak detection
--------------

30/ -- 'Minmax' peak detector for TIC

Simulator
---------

51/ -- GC-MS data simulator

Peak alignment by dynamic programming 
-------------------------------------

61/ -- Preparation of experiments for peak alignment by dynamic programming

61a/ -- Preparation of another set of experiments for peak alignment. This
    used in example 06/ where two the sets of experiments (prepared in 04/
    and 04a/) are aligned together

62/ -- Example of within-state peak alignment by dynamic programming. The
    experiments prepared in the example 61 are aligned

63/ -- Example of within-state and between-state peak alignment by dynamic
    programming. The experiments prepared in examples 61/ and 61a/ are
    aligned


Metric for the comparison of two peak lists
-------------------------------------------

68/ -- Compares an Xcalibur peak list with the AMDIS peak list

Mass spec libraries
-------------------

71/ -- Reading of the mass spectral library in JCAMP format

72/ -- Searching the mass spec library for the best match
