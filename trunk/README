Chapter 2
---------

20a/ -- Reading of GC-MS raw data in the JCAMP-DX format,
    and some properties of raw data object. The JCAMP-DX
    file used in this example was generated by GC/MS File
    Translator Pro (Scientific Instrument Services, Inc)

20b/ -- Reading of GC-MS raw data in the ANDI-MS format,
    and some properties of raw data object. The ANDI-MS file
    used in this example was generated by Agilent ChemStation.

20x/ -- Illustrates the use of diff() function

Chapter 3
---------

30/ -- Demonstrates building of the intensity matrix from
    raw GC-MS data, methods of the intensity matrix object,
    and how to save intensity matrix to a file.
