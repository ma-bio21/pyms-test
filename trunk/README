SUMMARY

Contains examples of PyMS use discussed in the PyMS User Guide

CONTENT

Basics
------

01/ -- Example demonstrating reading of GC-MS data from ChemStation (Agilent
    Technologies) ANDI-MS files, shows how to obtain ion chromatogram and TIC,
    and how to save data to a file

01a/ -- Xcalibur (Thermo) ANDI-MS file example, similar to 01/

02/ -- Explanation of signal peaks

03/ -- Example showing how to create an experiment from the ChemStation
    ANDI-MS file and the peak integration report files

Peak alignment examples
-----------------------

04/ -- Preparation of experiments for peak alignment by dynamic programming

04a/ -- Preparation of another set of experiments for peak alignment. This
    used in example 06/ where two the sets of experiments (prepared in 04/
    and 04a/) are aligned together

05/ -- Example of within-state peak alignment by dynamic programming. The
    experiments prepared in the example 04 are aligned

06/ -- Example of within-state and between-state peak alignment by dynamic
    programming. The experiments prepared in examples 04/ and 04a/ are
    aligned

Data pre processing
-------------------

11/ -- Noise filtering with mean/median moving windows 

12/ -- Noise filtering with Savitzky-Golay filter

21/ -- Top hat baseline correction

MS libraries
------------

31/ -- Demonstrates reading of the NIST library
