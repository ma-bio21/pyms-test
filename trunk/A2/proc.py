"""proc.py

This example demonstrates processing of a GC-TOF (Leco Pegasus-ChromaTOF)
generated dataset.

GC-TOF data is made up of nearly 10 scans per second. As a result of this,
the peak detection window in the Biller Biemann algorithm has a higher value
as compared to the value used to process GC-Quad data.

Due to the same reason, the value of the number of scans in the Biller
Biemann algorithm has a higher value as compared to the value used to
process GC-Quad data.
